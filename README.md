# Ideas

##Design 
 Load screen mostly html/ css with barely any JS for super fast loading.
	Loading page is the intro message more than a "laoding" state.
 Make most of it absolute and always animated/ moving
 Rotating Cube / Spider Graph with a category on each side / node.
	Link to related images using tags? ( Type, Category, Subject, Person, Color, MetaData?... )
 Images are often zoomed in or out, showcasing quality more?
 Transition from photo to photo with transparency masks?
	
## Techno
 React
 LazyLoad
 Spring animations
 Customm animations on time, function and requestAnimationFrame
 Detect Wifi or 3g
 Let user chose for lighter version?
